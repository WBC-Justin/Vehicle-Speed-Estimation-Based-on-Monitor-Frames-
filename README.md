# Vehicle-Speed-Estimation-Based-on-Monitor-Frames-

Traffic accidents happen every day. For the 
police, the most important task in dealing with traffic 
accidents is to clarify the responsibility for the accident. 
Since when the police arrive at the scene of the accident, 
it is already after the incident, although the current 
intersection monitor can provide the scene of the 
accident to assist the police in the accident 
identification, it can only provide a qualitative 
description. As to whether the vehicle is speeding, the 
part that requires quantitative information is still not 
available. In view of this shortcoming, this research 
uses AI image analysis technology to analyze the 
monitor frames to estimate the moving speed of the 
vehicle, assist the police to determine whether the 
vehicle is speeding, and clarify the legal responsibility 
of the vehicle.
